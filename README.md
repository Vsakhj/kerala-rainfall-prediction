# kerala-rainfall-prediction
A machine learning project to predict rainfall in Kerala using Python and Scikit-learn.
# Kerala Rainfall Prediction Project üå¶Ô∏è

## Project Goal
The goal of this project is to analyze historical rainfall data for Kerala and build a machine learning model to predict future rainfall based on past trends.

## Dataset
This project uses the "Rainfall in India 1901-2015" dataset, which is publicly available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rajanand/rainfall-in-india).

## Tools and Libraries Used
* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:**
    * `pandas` for data manipulation and cleaning.
    * `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization.
    * `scikit-learn` for building the machine learning model (`RandomForestRegressor`).
* **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook (via VS Code)

## Key Findings
* The analysis shows a clear monsoon pattern, with the highest rainfall occurring between June and August.
* The `RandomForestRegressor` model was able to predict monthly rainfall with an R¬≤ score of [Your R¬≤ Score], indicating a good fit.

## How to Run
1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Install the necessary libraries from the `requirements.txt` file (optional, but good practice).
3.  Open and run the `Rainfall_Analysis.ipynb` notebook.
